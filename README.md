### üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Guide
### Directory Structure
The plugin is organized into three main directories:
- **`block_editor_compatibility`**: Contains files for ensuring the plugin's compatibility with WordPress block editors.
- **`code_snippet`**: Houses the core functionality, including JavaScript, CSS, and PHP files for the TinyMCE integration.
- **`frontend`**: Manages frontend files such as `copy-code.php`, `copy-code.js`, and `copy-code.css` to handle code copying functionality.

### Frontend
The frontend directory contains three main files:
1. **`copy-code.php`**: PHP code to enqueue scripts and styles, and hooks into WordPress actions.
2. **`copy-code.js`**: JavaScript code to handle the code copying functionality and styling of code blocks.
3. **`copy-code.css`**: Styling for the copy code functionality.

#### Code Copying Functionality (JavaScript)
The following code snippet showcases how the plugin adds a copy code button to every code block:
```javascript
codeBlocks.forEach(function(block) {
  var button = document.createElement('span');
  button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    // Copy code functionality
  });
  // Append the button to the code block
});
```

#### Enqueue Scripts and Styles (PHP)
The plugin enqueues necessary styles and scripts for syntax highlighting and copy code functionality:
```php
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'code_snippet_enqueue_scripts');
add_action('admin_enqueue_scripts', 'code_snippet_enqueue_scripts');
```

### Code Snippet
The `code_snippet` directory manages the TinyMCE integration and includes:
1. **`code_snippet.css`**: Custom styles for the code snippet appearance.
2. **`code_snippet.js`**: JavaScript for TinyMCE plugin, handling code snippet insertion and editing.
3. **`code_snippet.php`**: PHP to enqueue scripts and styles.
4. **`icon.png`**: Icon for the TinyMCE toolbar button.

#### TinyMCE Integration (JavaScript)
The TinyMCE plugin is defined with a set of functionalities like syntax highlighting using Prism.js and code snippet insertion and editing:
```javascript
tinymce.create('tinymce.plugins.code_snippet', {
  init: function(editor, url) {
    // Initialization code here
  },
  // Additional functions and definitions
});
```

### Block Editor Compatibility
This part of the code ensures that the implementation is not only compatible with TinyMCE but also with the WordPress block editor. The compatibility layer allows for seamless transitions between different editor environments.

### Extending and Contributing
Developers can extend the functionality of the plugin or contribute to its development by forking the master branch, making changes, and submitting a pull request.
